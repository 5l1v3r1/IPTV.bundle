#### Plex Media Server plugin to play IPTV streams from a M3U playlist ####
version 1.0 RC1

- - -
Playlist must be generated using M3U standarts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U), stored in Contents\Resources folder and named playlist.m3u, there are some additional attributes supported:
* tvg-logo;
* group-title.
Included sample playlist may not work, but should serve well as an example.


Planned for the future:
* multi language support;
* configurable playlist name, possibility to use online playlist;
* [EPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide).


Please keep in mind that Plex does not has a native support for IPTV so it is possible that your stream just wont play on your client, and it definitely will not play in servers media manager, however I tested many streams on a PC client and LG TV and was unable to find one that would not work.
