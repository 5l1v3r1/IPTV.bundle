#### Plex Media Server plugin to play IPTV streams from M3U playlist ####
version 1.0 RC1

- - -
Playlist must be generated using M3U standarts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U), stored in Contents\Resources folder and named playlist.m3u, there are some additional attributes supported:
* tvg-logo;
* group-title.
Included sample playlist may not work, but should serve well as an example.


Planned for the future:
* multi language support;
* configurable playlist name, possibility to use online playlist;
* [EPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide).


Please keep in mind that Plex does not has a native support for IPTV so it is possible that your stream just wont play, however I tested many streams on a PC version and LG TV and was unable to find any issues. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me via GitHub. If you find this plugin usefull, please concider a small [donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=Cigaras%40gmail%2ecom&lc=LT&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted).
