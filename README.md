#### Plex Media Server plugin to play network streams (like IPTV) from a M3U playlist ####
version 1.0 RC1

- - -
Playlist must be generated using M3U standarts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U), stored in Contents\Resources folder and named playlist.m3u, there are some additional attributes supported:
* tvg-logo;
* group-title.

Included sample playlist may not work, but should serve well as an example. Should work on any client that is capable of playing desired network streams. Tested on:
* Plex Media Center for PC v.0.9.5.4
* LG 42LW650s TV

Planned for the future:
* multi language support;
* configurable playlist name, possibility to use online playlist;
* [EPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_program_guide).
