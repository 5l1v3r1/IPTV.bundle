Plex Media Server plugin to play IPTV streams from M3U playlist.

Playlist must be generated using M3U standarts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U), stored in Contents\Resources forlder and named playlist.m3u, there are some additional attributes supported:
* tvg-logo
* group-title

Included sample playlist will only work for me so you'll have to make your own, I don't have any public streams to give as an example.
